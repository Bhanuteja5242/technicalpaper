# SCALING: -
Scaling is generally a challange for engineers to plan capabilities of systems.

    Scalability is the measure of a system's ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands.This is of two types those are.
        1) Horizontal Scaling.
        2) Vertical Scaling.
# Horizontal Scaling: -
        Horizontal scaling tends to adding additional nodes or equipments to your infrastructure to work with new demands
        For example in simple words when we upgrade a application continuously the ram may not be capable to work with higher graphicsand all then this horizontal scaling is used to upgrade and then the performance increases, and compared to vertical scaling this was used for large range usage.

# Verical Scaling: -
        Vertical scaling refers to adding more resources (CPU RAM/DISK) to your server as on demand.
        For example in simple words this is used for small and mid range usage for large purpose it was not capable.
    
* Proper scaling can help system to work quickly and efficiently
* proper scaling means adding of RAM/disk to compete with the applications.

# If Scaling was improved: -
    Scaling refers to the adjustments made to system hardware resources to help your business grow by enabling your applications and systems to handle increased traffic and requests and your business to grow with improved scalability. This could be in the form of:

    Adjustments to network bandwidth 
    Upgrades to CPU capacity and physical memory 
    Basic hard drive alterations
# Scaling features for Vertical Scaling: -
* When we use vertical scaling for some extent untill it has heavy work load or more work it will be efficent but after that the price will be very high for maintenance.
